<h2 id="about">About</h2>

This project aims to make your documentation's write faster, at an "developer's hands distance", it can use an readme's template to generate yours for every new project by just input the fields, then it will be further changed with your inputs.

At the current stage, 23/05/2022, you only has one template at your disposal, but with the soon-to-be expansion of the reserved keywords you can create how many templates you wish.

That is a possibility of change some interactivity at some steps during updates.
At this moment I'm not aiming for full fledge cli program, but I think if I keep have ideas and others too it might grow to it.
